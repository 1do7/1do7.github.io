                    As you can tell I'm a noob at what I do so don't expect me to solve very hard boxes, I'm not good enough (yet).<br>
                    However I try to impove every day, this is why I decided to create a blog where I can keep my notes at.<br>
                    Also I won't go into complicated topics unless I can fully understand them and can give y'all proper information.<br>
                    So don't expect anything too 1337 from me.
